The code you're referring to is a Java program that reads a file and prints its contents to the console. Here's a line-by-line explanation:
import java.io.BufferedReader; - This line imports the BufferedReader class from the java.io package. BufferedReader is a Java class used to read text from a character-input stream, buffering characters so as to provide for the efficient reading of characters, arrays, and lines.
import java.io.FileReader; - This line imports the FileReader class from the java.io package. FileReader is a convenience class for reading character files.
class IOException extends Exception - This line defines a new class IOException that extends the Exception class. This is a custom exception class that can be thrown when an I/O error occurs.
IOException(String msg) - This is the constructor of the IOException class. It takes a string argument which is the detail message of the exception.
super(msg); - This line calls the constructor of the superclass Exception and passes the detail message to it.
